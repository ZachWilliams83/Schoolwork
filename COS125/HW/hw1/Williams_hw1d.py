# Description:
# Program aks user for a number 7 times and outputs the final number with no loops
# Collaboration:
# I did not discuss this assignment with anyone other than the course staff

# Request the user to input a number.
num = input("Enter a value: ")
num = input("Enter a value: ")
num = input("Enter a value: ")
num = input("Enter a value: ")
num = input("Enter a value: ")
num = input("Enter a value: ")
#program only prints final number because the variable is updated every input, it does not remain the same value as the previous input.
num = input("Enter a value: ")
print(num)
